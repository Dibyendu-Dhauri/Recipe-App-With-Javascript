# Recipe-App-With-Javascript
In this project, we will learn how to create a Recipe App. To build this project we need HTML, CSS and javascript.

In this project, we make use of the MealDB API. This API is easy to use. I would suggest this project for people who have basic knowledge of fetch().

The project consists of search input and a search button. The user enters the dish name of his choice into this input and hits the search button. When the user clicks on the search button, it displays an image of the respective meal, its name, and the country of origin.

Along with this, we also show a list of ingredients along with the measure. Next to the ingredients, we have a ‘View Recipe’ button. When the user clicks on this button, a pop up opens up with the instructions to cook the meal.
